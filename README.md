# Exploring-Watching-Behaviour-using-Own-Netflix-Data
This notebook showed how I explore my own watching behaviour using Netflix Data

Pre-requisite :
1. You need to download your own Netflix data 
2. Jupyter Notebook 

Step 1 :  Download Neflix data
Go to Netflix main website, log in and go to profile > Account > click Download our personal information > Request a copy of your information > Submit Request. Upon you click submit request, Netflix wil send you confirmation email which you need to click. 

Then you will have to wait,Netflix says preparing the data report might take up to 30 days. I got within 24 hours. Netflix will email you once the report are ready.

The download will be in zip file containing folders. You may open to content-interaction and open to viewing_activity.csv. For more clear understanding, you may navigate to PDFs titled additional information and cover sheet 


Step 2 : Get to know the data
The goal here is to find how is your interaction with netflix. We're going to study shows that you watched most and least . Also see when you spend your time watching netflix and particular show

Step 3 : Start your work !
In this area, I did 2 types of analyze.
1. I'm using the Alchemy of souls data to see day I spend most times watching it and at what hour I watched it
2. I analyzed needed column to see overall the 10 most watched programme and 10 least watched programme

Step 4 : Future idea 
I wanted to make it interactive by where you can input the programme and it show you how many seconds you spend watching it
